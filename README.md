# My Portfolio site
#### I have created a portfolio to showcase my skills and projects. To achieve this, I implemented the following :

#### BEM methodology
Structured code that's easy to understand and easily scalable. 

## CSS Grid & Flexbox
I created fluid layouts throughout the page with a mixture of Grid and Flexbox. The app is fully responsive on multiple screen widths.

## Javascript
I created functions to animate the navbar or the section of the titles, depending on the scroll position on the page.

## HTML
Designed the portfolio site structure using purely html elements.
